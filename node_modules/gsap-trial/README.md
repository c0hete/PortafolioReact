# GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) with Trial Bonus Files

*** **DO NOT DEPLOY THESE FILES!** ***

This package is only intended for experimentation during development. It contains the public <a href="https://greensock.com">GSAP</a> files plus all bonus plugins which are normally available exclusively to Club GreenSock members, including <a href="https://greensock.com/drawsvg">DrawSVGPlugin</a>, <a href="https://greensock.com/morphsvg">MorphSVGPlugin</a>, <a href="https://greensock.com/splittext">SplitText</a>, <a href="https://greensock.com/gsdevtools">GSDevTools</a>, <a href="https://greensock.com/intertia">InertiaPlugin</a>, and more. The trial plugins only work locally and on certain approved domains like codesandbox.io, codepen.io, stackblitz.com, and jsfiddle.com. Deploying them elsewhere violates the license and will result in a browser redirect! 

Sign up for <a href="https://greensock.com/club">Club GreenSock</a> to get the **completely unrestricted** files.

No GSAP files (including the trial plugins) implement any tracking whatsoever. No data is collected.

## Docs
View the <a href="https://greensock.com/docs">full documentation here</a>, including an <a href="https://greensock.com/install">installation guide</a> with videos.

## Usage on approved domain

On a whitelisted domain like <a href="https://codesandbox.io">codesandbox.io</a>, you can do this:
```javascript
// typical import
import gsap from "gsap-trial";

// or get other plugins:
import ScrollTrigger from "gsap-trial/ScrollTrigger";
import DrawSVGPlugin from "gsap-trial/DrawSVGPlugin";

// or all tools are exported from the "all" file (excluding bonus plugins):
import { gsap, ScrollTrigger, DrawSVGPlugin } from "gsap-trial/all";

// don't forget to register plugins
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger, DrawSVGPlugin); 
```
The NPM files are ES modules, but there's also a /dist/ directory with <a href="https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/">UMD</a> files for extra compatibility. Some build tools don't understand ES Modules in which case you can import the UMD files by adding /dist/ like:

```javascript
// UMD imports
import gsap from "gsap-trial/dist/gsap";
import MorphSVGPlugin from "gsap-trial/dist/MorphSVGPlugin";
```

### Use an alias to make upgrading simple
Install the package as a "gsap" alias so that when you join <a href="https://greensock.com/club">Club GreenSock</a> and get the unrestricted files, all you have to do is install those and make zero changes to all your imports!

```javascript
npm install gsap@npm:gsap-trial
```
Now we can simply use "gsap" in place of "gsap-trial", so the imports could look like this:
```javascript
import gsap from "gsap";
import DrawSVGPlugin from "gsap/DrawSVGPlugin";
```


## How do I get unrestricted files?
Once you're a <a href="https://greensock.com/club/">Club GreenSock</a> member, download the unrestricted plugins from your GreenSock.com account and then include them in your own JS payload. There are no "phone home" scripts that track usage and the plugins won't suddenly stop working if/when your membership expires. We treat others the way we'd like to be treated and our entire business model is built on the honor system. Read about it <a href="https://greensock.com/why-license">here</a>. GreenSock has a <a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#private">private NPM registry</a> for members too. 

Post your questions in our <a href="https://greensock.com/forums/">forums</a> and we'd be happy to help.

### License
Please do not use any of the bonus plugins without the proper license which comes with Club GreenSock memberships.

See <a href="https://greensock.com/licensing/">http://greensock.com/licensing/</a> for details. Why doesn't GreenSock use an MIT (or similar) open source license, and why is that a **good** thing?
